# Learning Room Automation Setup & Maintenance Guide

## Overview

The Learning Room uses GitHub Actions workflows to provide real-time feedback to students as they work through challenges in their individual Classroom repos. This guide explains how the system works and how to maintain or extend it.

### The Automation Stack

| Workflow | Purpose | Triggers |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `pr-validation-bot.yml` | Gandalf bot -- welcomes first-timers, validates PR structure | PR opened/edited/reviewed |
| `content-validation.yml` | Checks links, Markdown, accessibility | PR opened/edited |
| `student-progression.yml` | Creates the first challenge and unlocks the next challenge issue in sequence | Workflow dispatch, issue closed |
| `skills-progression.yml` | Posts achievement and progress feedback | PR merged |
| `autograder-conflicts.yml` | Validates merge conflict resolution (Ch07) | PR opened/edited |
| `autograder-local-commit.yml` | Validates local Git commit (Ch10) | Push to branch |
| `autograder-template.yml` | Validates issue template creation (Ch14) | Issues created |
| `autograder-capstone.yml` | Validates capstone challenge (Ch16) | PR opened |

### How Student Branches Work

1. **Student creates a branch** from main to work on their challenge
   - Branch naming: `fix/studentname-issue123` or `feature/studentname-skill`

2. **Student opens a PR** against `main` (or their own tracking branch)
   - References the issue: `Closes #123`

3. **Workflows run automatically:**
   - `pr-validation-bot`: Validates structure, welcomes first-timers
   - `content-validation`: Checks links, markdown, accessibility

- `student-progression`: Creates the next challenge when an issue closes
- `skills-progression`: Awards badges when a PR merges

1. **Student receives feedback** in PR comments within ~30 seconds

2. **Student makes updates** to their branch; workflows re-run automatically

3. **Peer reviewer approves** (facilitated by facilitator)

4. **PR is merged** → skills-progression workflow celebrates

## Workflow Details

### 1. PR Validation Bot (`pr-validation-bot.yml`)

**What it does:**

- Welcomes new contributors with orientation
- Validates PR has issue reference (`Closes #123`)
- Validates PR has meaningful description
- Provides educational feedback with links to resources
- Auto-responds to help requests in comments

**Key Scripts:**

- `validate-pr.js` — Checks PR requirements
- `validation-report.js` — Formats feedback
- `comment-responder.js` — Handles help requests

**Customization for Future Workshops:**
Edit `validate-pr.js` to change what's validated. Keep checks *encouraging* not *blocking*.

### 2. Content Validation (`content-validation.yml`)

**What it does:**

- Validates all markdown links exist
- Checks markdown structure (headings, lists, code blocks)
- Identifies accessibility issues (alt text, link text, tables)
- Provides clear, educational feedback

**Key Scripts:**

- `check_links.py` — Validates relative/absolute links
- `check_markdown.py` — Validates heading hierarchy, formatting
- `check_accessibility.py` — Checks for missing alt text, poor link text

**Customization for Future Workshops:**
Update the Python scripts to match your accessibility standards. The regex patterns control what gets flagged.

### 3. Skills Progression (`skills-progression.yml`)

**What it does:**

- Awards achievement badges when PRs merge
- Celebrates milestones (first PR, 5th PR, etc.)
- Tracks skill categories (markdown, accessibility, review, collaboration)
- Suggests next challenges to students

**Key Scripts:**

- Built into the workflow using `actions/github-script`

**Customization for Future Workshops:**
Edit the badge names, skill categories, and celebration messages in `skills-progression.yml` to match your workshop theme.

## Setup Instructions (For New Workshop)

### Prerequisites

- GitHub organization with access to create/edit workflows
- Node.js 20+ (for local testing)
- Python 3.11+ (for link validation)

### Step 1: Copy to New Repository

The learning-room workflows are **ready to replicate**. To use for a new workshop:

```bash
# Copy the entire .github directory from learning-room to your new repo
cp -r learning-room/.github your-new-learning-room/.github

# Copy package.json
cp learning-room/package.json your-new-learning-room/package.json

# Update docs references in workflows (search/replace paths)
# Example: Change `../docs/` paths to match your documentation structure
```

### Step 2: Customize for Your Workshop

**Edit `.github/workflows/pr-validation-bot.yml`:**

```yaml
# Change welcome message
welcomeBody: 'Your custom welcome message...'

# Update resource links to your documentation
```

**Edit `.github/workflows/skills-progression.yml`:**

```yaml
# Customize badge names and skill categories
badges:
  markdown: 'Your Badge Name'
  accessibility: 'Your Badge Name'
  # Add/remove skill types as needed
```

**Edit Python validation scripts (`.github/scripts/check_*.py`):**

```python
# Update accessibility standards to match your requirements
# Update link patterns, heading rules, etc.
```

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
cd learning-room

# Test PR validation script
node .github/scripts/validate-pr.js

# Test link checker
python .github/scripts/check_links.py .

# Test markdown validator
python .github/scripts/check_markdown.py .

# Test accessibility checker
python .github/scripts/check_accessibility.py .
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Repository

1. Push `.github/` directory to your repository
2. Ensure repository has GitHub Actions enabled
3. Create test PR to verify workflows run

## Maintaining & Extending

### Adding New Validation Rules

**To add a new check to PR bot:**

1. Edit `.github/scripts/validate-pr.js`
2. Add a new function, e.g., `checkMyRule()`
3. Push results to `results.required` or `results.suggestions`
4. Call your function in `runValidation()`

**Example:**

```javascript
function checkMyRule() {
  const passes = /* your check */;
  results.required.push({
    name: 'My Custom Rule',
    passed: passes,
    message: 'Clear message explaining what passed/failed',
    help: 'How to fix it'
  });
}
```

**To add a new Python validator:**

1. Create new file: `.github/scripts/check_yourcheck.py`
2. Add to workflow: `.github/workflows/content-validation.yml`
3. Ensure it writes output to `validation-feedback.json`

### Adding New Skill Categories

**To track new skills:**

1. Edit `.github/workflows/skills-progression.yml`
2. Add new label recognition:

   ```yaml
   if (labels.includes('skill: yourskill')) {
     skillType = 'yourskill';
     badgeName = ' Your Badge';
   }
   ```

3. Update `skillDescription` and other references
4. Consider adding to challenge issues with appropriate labels

### Monitoring & Troubleshooting

**Check workflow logs:**

- Go to Actions tab in repository
- Click workflow run
- Check "Annotations" tab for any issues

**Common Issues:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Python scripts not found | Ensure file permissions: `chmod +x check_*.py` |
| Node dependencies missing | Run `npm ci` before tests |
| Links broken in feedback | Update relative paths in Python scripts |
| Workflows not triggering | Check `on:` conditions and branch settings |

## Performance Considerations

### Workflow Optimization

The current setup:

- **Fast triggers**: Feedback within ~30 seconds
- **Efficient checks**: Python validators run in parallel
- **Caching**: npm dependencies cached between runs

**To optimize further:**

- Use workflow caching for large dependency sets
- Limit file validation to changed files only (advanced)
- Consider separate workflows for different check types

### Scalability

As student count grows:

- Current setup handles 100+ concurrent PRs
- API rate limits: GitHub allows 1000 API calls per workflow run
- If you hit limits: consolidate checks or split into multiple workflows

## Documentation Best Practices

Document your changes in `.github/README.md` or in your main Learning Room documentation:

### What to Document

- Which checks are enabled and why
- How to interpret bot feedback  
- How students request help from the bot
- What to do if bot feedback seems wrong
- How facilitators can override bot decisions

### Student-Facing Guide

Create a guide explaining:

- What the bot validates
- Why each check matters
- How to fix common issues
- When to ask for human review

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Ideas

- [ ] Automated skill level progression (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)
- [ ] Progress dashboard showing student completion rates
- [ ] Custom challenge sequencing based on skill levels
- [ ] Peer review assignment automation
- [ ] Integration with GitHub Projects for progress tracking

### Community Contributions

This system is designed to be extended! Future contributors can:

- Add new validators
- Create educational resources
- Improve error messages
- Translate feedback to other languages

## Troubleshooting

### Workflows Not Running

**Check:**

1. Is GitHub Actions enabled? (Settings → Actions)
2. Do workflows have correct permissions? (Check `permissions:` field)
3. Is the branch protection rule blocking? (Settings → Branches)

**Fix:**

```yaml
# Ensure workflows have needed permissions
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
```

### Validation False Positives

**If bot rejects valid content:**

1. Check the specific validation rule in the Python/JS script
2. Consider if the rule is too strict
3. Update the rule or add an exception
4. Document the change

### Students Can't Trigger Actions

**Ensure:**

- Workflows have correct `on:` triggers
- Student branches push to the repository (not forks)
- No branch protection blocks the workflow permission
